    <p class="highlight" center-this>My name is Eunjae Lee,and my English name is Jenny.</strong> I am from Korea. I am interested in English, but my English skills is not good.
        My strength is that Iâ€™m good with people.</a></p>

    <p class="highlight" center-this> I wanted to take advantage of my strengths and have a job that always requires communication with many people from my childhood. Among them, I became interested in UI/UX designers. Also, I majored in video production and photography before joining George Brown. I don't have much knowledge, but I also used my knowledge to come to Canada with a dream of getting a job I wanted, and I chose George Brown College Interaction Design.<a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-program-g113"> interaction design detailed.</a></p>

    <h2 class="about"><em>My favorite</em></h2>
    <p class="highlight"> My favorite things are travel and movies.Before the current situation of Covid-19, I always enjoyed traveling abroad several times a year and decided to study in Canada because I wanted to live abroad while traveling and feeling. Also, after watching a movie, I decided to travel because I wanted to go to the background of the movie. Travel and movies are indispensable items in my life. </a></p>
